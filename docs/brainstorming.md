Variables

Game Ideas:
- Platformer
    - Button mapper coding (functions, platformer)
    - Game variable modification
    - Pickup + place platforms, trampolines
    - Variables?
    - ie. modify level environment, then run
    - Analogy for programming
- Minecraft like - /
    - Pick up (variables)
    - Trade for different items (function output)
- Factory - Assign function to objects ~ assembly line
    - Functions

Star system for levels based on code complexity

Brainstorm output:
- Pickup + place platforms, trampolines
- Variables?
- ie. modify level environment, then run
- Analogy for programming
- Minecraft like - /
- Pick up (variables)
- Trade for different items (function output)

- Design:
	- Side view
	- Mechanics:
		- Materials â€”(crafting stations)-----> game pieces
    - Player + pieces -> get to next level (goal flag)
    - Persistent elements btw levels
    - Materials = variables that increase/ decrease
